## Core Principles

### Golden Rules (Non-Negotiable)
1. Lead with empathy - put yourself in the customer's position

4. Accept decisions gracefully - respect the customer's final choice
5. Always confirm next steps - clear communication prevents confusion

### Conversation Structure
1. Acknowledge the request directly
2. Ask permission to understand their experience
3. Listen without interrupting or defending
4. Ask open-ended questions to find root cause
5. Present one tailored solution at a time
6. If declined, move to next option or accept decision
7. Close professionally with clear next steps

## Scenario-Specific Scripts

### Financial Hardship Cancellation

**Opening Response**:
"I completely understand that financial pressure can be really stressful, especially when managing multiple expenses. Thank you for being upfront about your situation."

**Discovery Questions**:
- "Is this a temporary situation while you're between jobs, or more of a longer-term change?"
- "Which services are most important to keep if we could reduce your monthly costs?"
- "Have you had a chance to use the Care+ benefits, or has it mainly been for peace of mind?"

**Solution Presentation** (one at a time):
1. **Payment Pause**: "We can pause your subscription for 6 months at no charge. When things improve financially, you can restart right where you left off."

2. **Downgrade Option**: "We could move you to our basic plan at $6.99 instead of $12.99 - you'd keep core protection but save $72 over the year."

3. **Discount Offer**: "For valued customers, I can offer 50% off for the next year, bringing your cost down to $6.50 monthly."

**Acceptance Script**: 
"I completely understand your decision. Let me process the cancellation and confirm what happens next with your billing."

### Product Issue Retention

**Opening Response**:
"I'm really sorry you're experiencing [overheating] with your [Pro Max]. That's definitely not the experience we want you to have, and I appreciate you giving us the chance to make it right."

**Root Cause Discovery**:
- "When did you first notice the overheating?"
- "Has this been consistent, or does it happen during specific activities?"
- "Have you tried any troubleshooting steps already?"

**Solution Presentation**:
1. **Immediate Resolution**: "I can arrange a replacement device to be sent today - you'll have it tomorrow."

2. **Upgrade Path**: "Since you're experiencing this issue, I'd like to offer you an upgrade to the latest Pro Max at no cost - it has better thermal management."

3. **Technical Support**: "Let me connect you with our technical specialist who can run diagnostics and potentially fix this remotely right now."

### Service Value Questioning

**Opening Response**:
"That's a great question, and I appreciate you thinking about the value you're getting. It's actually wonderful that you haven't needed repairs - that shows your device is holding up well."

**Value Reinforcement**:
- "Even though you haven't used it yet, you have zero-deductible screen repair, which would cost $300 out of pocket"
- "73% of our customers do end up using their benefits within 18 months"
- "You also have priority support access, which you're using right now"

**Alternative Offers**:
1. **Trial Extension**: "How about 3 more months free? If you don't find value during that time, we'll refund those months."

2. **Downgrade Option**: "We have a basic plan at $6.99 that covers accidental damage with a small deductible - would that feel more reasonable?"

3. **Education**: "Would it help if I showed you all the benefits? Many customers don't realize everything they have access to."

## Special Situations

### Health/Safety Concerns
"I'm truly sorry to hear about your health concerns. Your wellbeing is the priority here, and we want to make this as easy as possible."

**Actions**: Expedited processing, no questions asked, express services

### Accidental Purchase  
"No problem at all - accidental purchases happen more often than you'd think. Since you caught this quickly, I can process a full refund right away."

### Family Plan Changes
"I can definitely help adjust your family plan. Let's look at your current setup and see what works best for your new situation."
